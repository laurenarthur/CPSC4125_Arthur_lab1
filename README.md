Link: https://github.com/laurenarthur/CPSC4125_Arthur_lab1

Synopsis: In this program the user will type what they want to add to the to-do list that already has some stuff on it.
            When they press the add button the item gets added to the list. Each item on the lsit had a X appended to them 
            this allows the user to press that and removes the item from the list.
